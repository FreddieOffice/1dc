this is an esoteric programming language written in lua 
is alsow known as "N--".
by the way lua53.dll is needed for ONE-C.exe and note that the interpreter is KIND OF BUGGY!!! (or its just my bad coding)
also haha 1c and ONE-C

functions:
p <char>: will print the characters after the "p" with a new line (p = print (like you couldnt guess))
pwn <char>: will print the characters after the "pwn" without a newline (pwn = Print Without Newline)
pv <var>: will print a variable without a newline

v <char> = <char>: set a variable

r <char>: will ask for input and then put the inputted text into the <char> (variable)
w <int>: will wait for <int> seconds
o <char> <char>: will open a file, read it, put its characters into a variable.
exec <char>: call a terminal command

use:
command prompt:
    lua ONE-C.lua <filename>.1dc
    lua<luaversion> ONE-C.lua <filename>.1dc
powershell:
    lua .\ONE-C.lua .\<filename>.1dc
    lua<luaversion> .\ONE-C.lua .\<filename>.1dc
