this is an esoteric programming language written in lua 
old name was "ONE-C"
note that the interpreter is KIND OF BUGGY!!! (or its just my bad coding)

functions:
p <char>: will print the characters after the "p" with a new line (p = print (like you couldnt guess))
pwn <char>: will print the characters after the "pwn" without a newline (pwn = Print Without Newline)
pv <var>: will print a variable without a newline

v <char> = <char>: set a variable

r <char>: will ask for input and then put the inputted text into the <char> (variable)
w <int>: will wait for <int> seconds
or <char> = <char>: will open a file, read it, put its characters into a variable.
ow <char> = <char>: will open a file, write to it whats in the second <char>.
exec <char>: call a terminal command

use:
command prompt:
    1dc.exe <filename>.1dc or 1dc <filename>.1dc (if in path)
powershell:
    1dc.exe .\<filename>.1dc or 1dc .\<filename>.1dc (if in paht)

or just open 1dc.exe or open 1dc.exe from powershell or cmd
